# Hanging-man-
Simple game of hanging man in python 3 withous using the random package. 
(can easliy be added in order to choose a word randomly for the user- but in thise case we wanted to program a game without using any packages at all)

The user choose a word, then he is asked for a letter- if the letter appears in the word then the user is correct and his correct guesses so far will be printed along with the hang man drawing (only if he alredy had mistakes, if no mastakes were doen only the corrects guesses will be printed)
If a correct letter was eing input angain - a warnning will be printed letting the user know that and then give him the option to input a letter again
If a wrong letter was input then a warning will be printed as well as the appropriate hang man drawing.
if the number of mistakes is less then 6, the uer will be able to try another letter, else the game is over.
